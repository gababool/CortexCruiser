In my git repo, my team will have a transcript log of LLM usage. What would be a good way to name those files? like a standard format


ChatGPT said:
A good naming convention should be consistent, descriptive, and sortable. Here are a few structured formats you might use:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Date-Based Naming (ISO 8601 format)
plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md
Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-2025-03-29.md
Pros: Sorts naturally in chronological order.

Cons: If multiple logs exist per day, they might need additional differentiation.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Date + Time-Based Naming
plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-2025-03-29-1430.md
Pros: Ensures uniqueness if multiple logs are created on the same day.

Cons: Slightly longer filenames.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sequential Numbering Per Day
plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md
Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-2025-03-29-001.md
llm-log-2025-03-29-002.md
Pros: Good for teams logging multiple times a day.

Cons: Requires tracking the sequence number.

4Ô∏è‚É£ User/Team Identifier + Date
plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-USERNAME-YYYY-MM-DD.md
Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-alice-2025-03-29.md
Pros: Helps track who created each log.

Cons: Can get messy with many users unless properly managed.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Project-Specific Naming
plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-PROJECT-YYYY-MM-DD.md
Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
llm-log-chatbot-2025-03-29.md
Pros: Useful when multiple projects use LLMs.

Cons: Needs consistent project naming.

üìå Recommendation:
If you want something simple and scalable, Option 2 (Date + Time) or Option 3 (Date + Sequence) is usually best for ensuring uniqueness while keeping things organized.
