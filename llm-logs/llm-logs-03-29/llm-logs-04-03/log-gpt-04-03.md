You need to analyse the content of the file and create a plot:

      GroundSteeringAngle over time

So, for the given recording, you need to identify the signal that corresponds to the steering wheel angle and extract the values for this particular message. The application OpenDLV-Vehicle-View provides various features to achieve this; one would be to extract the messages into a set of .csv files and import the corresponding .csv file into an application that allows you to visualise and plot it.

What data corresponds to GroundSteeringAngle over time?


ChatGPT said:
The data corresponding to GroundSteeringAngle over time is found in the messages with the identifier:

opendlv_proxy_GroundSteeringRequest

From the provided data, the relevant entry is:

yaml
Copy
Edit
1090 0 opendlv_proxy_GroundSteeringRequest 1584543173246989 groundSteering: 0
This means:

Timestamp: 1584543173246989 (in microseconds)

Ground Steering Angle (groundSteering): 0

To plot GroundSteeringAngle over time, you would extract all instances of opendlv_proxy_GroundSteeringRequest from the dataset and plot the groundSteering values against their corresponding timestamps. Would you like me to generate sample code for extracting and plotting this data?

im trying to plot this in gnuplot. i want to plot it as GroundSteeringAngle over time, can you help me with the gnuplot commands to achieve this

ChatGPT said:
Yes! You can use gnuplot to plot "Ground Steering Angle" over time. Assuming your data is stored in a file called ground_steering.csv, follow these steps:

Steps:
Ensure your CSV file is tab-separated (or adjust accordingly).

The time for the x-axis can be derived from sampleTimeStamp.seconds and sampleTimeStamp.microseconds.

The ground steering angle is in the groundSteering column.

Gnuplot Commands:
gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator "\t"  # Set tab as the separator
set xdata time
set timefmt "%s"  # Unix timestamp format
set format x "%H:%M:%S"  # Display time in readable format
set xlabel "Time (HH:MM:SS)"
set ylabel "Ground Steering Angle"
set title "Ground Steering Angle Over Time"
set grid

plot "ground_steering.csv" using ($6 + $7/1e6):8 with lines title "Steering Angle"
Explanation:
$6 refers to sampleTimeStamp.seconds.

$7 refers to sampleTimeStamp.microseconds (divided by 1,000,000 to convert to seconds).

$8 refers to groundSteering.

Combining seconds + microseconds/1e6 gives a precise time representation.

The x-axis is formatted in a human-readable time (HH:MM:SS).

Next Steps:
Run this script inside gnuplot, and it should generate the desired plot! 🚀 Let me know if you need any tweaks.

         x range is invalid


ChatGPT said:
The error "Skipping data file with no valid points" and "x range is invalid" suggests one of the following issues:

File format issue – The data might not be tab-separated as expected.

Column misalignment – The script references columns 6 and 7 for timestamps and 8 for Ground Steering, but these might not match your file's structure.

Incorrect data type – The timestamp might not be in a numeric format or has missing values.

Fixing the Issue
Try these steps:

1. Verify the file structure
Check the actual delimiter used in opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv:

bash
Copy
Edit
head -n 5 opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv
If values are separated by commas, update gnuplot to:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator ","
If separated by spaces, use:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator " "
2. Verify column indexes
In gnuplot, try:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 1:2
This helps identify which columns hold the timestamps. If the timestamps appear incorrect:

Manually inspect column numbers by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
awk '{print NR, $0}' opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv | head -n 10
Update the script with the correct column indices.

3. Remove header (if any)
If the first row contains column names, add this to your gnuplot script:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set key autotitle columnheader
or manually remove it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
tail -n +2 opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv > cleaned_data.csv
Then, use cleaned_data.csv in gnuplot.

4. Debug the timestamp conversion
Try plotting raw timestamps:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 6:8 with lines
If that works, then the issue is likely in microseconds conversion.

Instead of ($6 + $7/1e6), try:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 6:8 with lines
or

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($6 + $7 * 1e-6):8 with lines
Final gnuplot Script (Fixed)

set xdata time
set timefmt "%s"  
set format x "%H:%M:%S"  
set xlabel "Time (HH:MM:SS)"

earlier i used this, and it created an ugly ahh plot that just looked like a staircase. now, with your settings, if i do plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 1 title 'Line 1' with lines
that gives:  plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 1 title 'Line 1' with lines
                                                                                           ^
         Need full using spec for x time data


ChatGPT said:
The error "Need full using spec for x time data" happens because gnuplot expects both X (time) and Y (groundSteering) values when using set xdata time.

Since your previous plot looked like a staircase, that likely means your data points were constant over time, or the X-axis values were not properly formatted.

Fix the Gnuplot Command
Use the correct column indices for time and groundSteering:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set terminal svg size 500,400 enhanced fname 'arial' fsize 5 solid
set output 'out.svg'    # Output must always be named 'out.svg' to display.

set title 'Ground Steering Angle Over Time'
set xlabel 'Time (HH:MM:SS)'
set ylabel 'Ground Steering Angle'
set key inside top left
set grid

# Configure time formatting
set xdata time
set timefmt "%s"
set format x "%H:%M:%S"

# Ensure correct column mapping: ($6 = seconds, $7 = microseconds, $8 = groundSteering)
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($6 + $7 * 1e-6):8 with lines title "Steering Angle"
Why This Works
$6 → sampleTimeStamp.seconds (Unix timestamp)

$7 → sampleTimeStamp.microseconds (converted to seconds)

$6 + $7 * 1e-6 → Full timestamp in seconds

$8 → groundSteering (Y-axis value)

This will ensure a smooth line instead of a staircase effect.

If the Plot Still Looks Bad
Try adding smoother curves:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($6 + $7 * 1e-6):8 smooth csplines with lines title "Steering Angle"
This applies cubic splines for a smoother look.

         undefined variable: “opendlv why is it like this


ChatGPT said:
The issue is likely due to incorrect quote characters in your gnuplot command. You are using curly quotes (“ and ”) instead of standard double quotes ("). Gnuplot does not recognize curly quotes as valid syntax.

Fix: Use Standard Quotes
Replace curly quotes (“ and ”) with standard double quotes (").

Corrected Command:
gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($1/1000000.0):2 with lines title "Calculated Steering Angle" lc rgb "red", \
     "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($1/1000000.0):3 with lines title "Actual Ground Steering" lc rgb "blue"
Why This Works
" " → Standard quotes (fixes syntax errors)

($1/1000000.0) → Converts microseconds to seconds

2 and 3 → Ensures correct column usage for Y-values

lc rgb "red" & lc rgb "blue" → Defines line colors

Next Steps
Copy-paste the corrected command without modifying quotes.

If the issue persists, check if your file is properly formatted using:

bash
Copy
Edit
head -n 5 opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv
Ensure columns are correctly separated.

this is the output using that command.


ChatGPT said:
Your file uses semicolons (;) as the delimiter instead of tabs or commas.
By default, gnuplot expects tab or space-separated values, so you need to specify the correct separator.

Fix: Tell Gnuplot to Use Semicolons
Modify your gnuplot script to include:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator ";"
Updated Gnuplot Command
gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator ";"
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($5 + $6/1e6):7 with lines title "Ground Steering Angle" lc rgb "blue"
Explanation of Fix
set datafile separator ";" → Ensures gnuplot correctly reads semicolon-separated values.

$5 + $6/1e6 → Converts sampleTimeStamp.seconds ($5) and sampleTimeStamp.microseconds ($6) into a proper time format.

$7 → Uses the groundSteering column for the Y-axis.

lc rgb "blue" → Sets line color to blue for better visualization.

Try This Next
Copy and paste the corrected command directly into gnuplot.

If the plot still looks incorrect, try:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 5:7 with lines
This helps check if timestamps ($5) and steering values ($7) are read correctly.

If you get "invalid x-range", ensure that your data doesn't contain a header row by skipping the first line:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "< tail -n +2 opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($5 + $6/1e6):7 with lines title "Ground Steering Angle"
This should generate the correct Ground Steering Angle over time plot. Let me know how it works! 🚀

this is still happening


ChatGPT said:
The error "Skipping data file with no valid points" and "x range is invalid" suggests that gnuplot isn't reading the file correctly. Let's systematically debug and fix this.

Step 1: Check If Gnuplot Reads the File Properly
Run this command inside gnuplot:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator ";"
plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 5:7 with lines
Expected Output:
If it works → The issue was with time conversion, skip to Step 3.

If it still throws an error, continue to Step 2.

Step 2: Check File Content in Terminal
Run this in your terminal (outside gnuplot):

bash
Copy
Edit
cat opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv | head -n 5
You should see:

Copy
Edit
sent.seconds;sent.microseconds;received.seconds;received.microseconds;sampleTimeStamp.seconds;sampleTimeStamp.microseconds;groundSteering;
1584543153;123020;868;609817;1584543153;123020;-0;
1584543153;223548;868;710347;1584543153;223548;-0;
If the first line contains column names, tell gnuplot to skip it:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
plot "< tail -n +2 opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 5:7 with lines
If it still doesn't work, your file may have extra spaces or non-numeric characters. Run this in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
awk -F";" '{print $5, $7}' opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv | head -n 5
This prints columns 5 and 7 to confirm they contain numeric values.

Step 3: Fix Timestamp Conversion
If plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using 5:7 worked, the issue is with the microsecond conversion.
Modify your gnuplot script:

gnuplot
Copy
Edit
set datafile separator ";"
set xdata time
set timefmt "%s"
set format x "%H:%M:%S"

plot "opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv" using ($5 + $6 * 1e-6):7 with lines title "Ground Steering Angle"
Final Check
✅ If it works: The problem was the initial column selection or missing set datafile separator ";".

❌ If it still fails: Your file might have hidden formatting issues (extra spaces, non-numeric characters). Try:

bash
Copy
Edit
tr -d '\r' < opendlv.proxy.GroundSteeringRequest-0.csv > fixed.csv
Then plot using fixed.csv.
