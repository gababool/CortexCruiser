>> How do we plan to collaborate?
... 
... Use GitLab for version control and use workflow adhering to good Git practices such as Issue track
... ing, feature branching, merge request reviews and continuous integration.
... Dedicate Monday & Friday mornings to mandatory meetings for discussing planning, review and contin
... uously develop the group’s process.
... Opportunity for hybrid work with an agreed upon preference for meeting on campus. Generally group 
... work sessions will take place at 10:30 on weekdays. Any divergence from this agreed upon time or a
... dditional meetings will be scheduled as needed, including potential weekend meetings.
... Discord will be used for all online communication in the dedicated project Discord server.
... 
... 
... How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
... 
... During meetings and collaborative sessions, individual contributions are to be explained by any me
... mber that has contributed individually to keep the rest of the team informed.
... GitLab provides integration with Discord through webhooks, which will be implemented in the team’s
...  server and allow the team to stay updated on any action taken in GitLab by members, including but
...  not limited to issue actions, branch actions, commits, merge requests, comments, pipeline runs et
... c.
... A shared Google Drive folder will be utilized by the team to document any artifacts created outsid
... e of Git such as potential lecture notes, teacher feedback etc. that could be relevant in the cour
... se.
... 
... 
... How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
... 
... Collaborative programming sessions and general course discussions will take place regularly.
... These sessions, mentioned in section 1, will include rundowns, code reviews, tool-help etc and wil
... l naturally facilitate an environment where questions members could have to each other are answere
... d quickly and knowledge will be freely exchanged.
... Other feedback mechanisms will be used in the form of constructive merge request feedback and a se
... gment of our collaborative sessions/mandatory meetings where each member answers the question “is 
... there anything you are uncertain of?”.
... The GitLab repo will contain documentation regarding setup, code explanations and more information
...  regarding the project’s process in the form of README docs or in the repo’s Wiki.
... 
... 
... What is our usual communication plan?
... 
... Communication over the Discord server will be consistent during weekdays
... Notice of late arrival or absence should be communicated to the team with reasonable heads up (i.e
... . not after a meeting starts) unless the circumstances are exceptional.
... Logistical matters can be communicated over the joint Snapchat group or Discord (e.g. “I will arri
... ve in 5 min”)
... Weekend communication is reserved for critical matters or otherwise agreed upon beforehand
... 
... 
... How will we solve conflicts?
... 
... To best handle conflicts, all members will embrace the team’s core values such as treating each ot
... her with respect, accept constructive criticism, have empathy for one another and share the belief
...  that everyone works for what is best for the team.
... In case of unresolved disagreements, each party should present their reasoning to the whole of the
...  team and a decision will be taken together either through agreement or a vote.
... In the event of irremediable disagreements, the issue will be escalated to course Teaching Assista
... nts and or the course examiner.

... How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and
...  traceably document the use of LLMs?
... 
... Ensuring responsible use
... 
... 
... Full disclosure: All members are to disclose the presence of generated material with no exceptions
... . This includes but is not limited to: re-writing text, ideas, source code etc.
... Generated source code is not to be merged into the main git branch unless agreed upon by at least 
... 2 other members. Generating source code is to be reserved for special occasions at the discretion 
... of the team meaning as a guideline we strive for all source code to be human-made.
... Using LLMs to understand concepts or look up specific syntax does not need to be disclosed. Anythi
... ng generated by LLMs should be viewed with scrutiny and caution as it could “hallucinate” or conta
... in wrong information.
... 
... 
... Traceability of LLM use
... 
... 
... Re-written text should be accompanied by the original, human-made text as reference.
... All generated material should have relevant LLM chat logs transcribed and stored in the Git repo. 
... For traceability, any issue, merge request, source code file etc should contain comments linking t
... o the relevant transcripts - Our feedback for this code of conduct is as follows: Thanks for your 
... code-of-conduct. Please find my comments below:
... 
... 
...         
...       It is left unclear whether you plan to primarily work on-site or remotely. I suggest that yo
... u try to find a good balance between digital and non-digital meetings as on-site meetings facilita
... te better knowledge sharing and transfer, as well as brainstorming.
... 
...         
...       What are your plans to avoid conflicts from happening in the first place?
... 
...         
...       Please update your guidelines on where and when to use an LLM during your project, in partic
... ular more clearly where you as a group agree/accept to use it for "special occasions" as the curre
... nt description is a bit too vague to provide guidance
... Please revise your code-of-conduct and submit the Git hash of the commit that incorporates your ch
... anges for me to review. Then, I will close this issue ticket. - Can you give me suggestions on how
...  to improve my code of conduct based on the feedback. Address each point specifically.
1. Balance between on-site and remote work: To ensure a balance between digital and non-digital 
meetings, we suggest arranging a schedule that includes a mix of both. This can help facilitate 
better knowledge sharing and transfer, as well as brainstorming. For instance, we could arrange 
weekly in-person group work sessions at the campus, while utilizing online collaboration tools 
like Discord for daily communication and real-time discussions.
  2. Conflict prevention: To minimize conflicts from happening, we can focus on building a 
strong team culture that encourages open communication, mutual respect, constructive criticism, 
empathy, and a shared commitment to what's best for the group. Additionally, we should establish 
regular check-ins within our meetings to discuss any concerns or issues arising among team 
members.
  3. LLM usage guidelines: To provide clearer guidance on when to use an LLM during our project, 
we can specify that it will be used for looking up specific syntax, understanding concepts, or 
generating material only as a guideline and with caution. We should also ensure that all 
generated material is disclosed, accompanied by the original human-made text as reference, and 
transcribed chat logs from using LLMs are stored in the Git repo. Finally, we should establish a 
clear process for reviewing, approving, and merging generated source code into the main git 
branch to maintain transparency and accountability.
  4. Revised Code of Conduct (CoC): With these suggestions in mind, here's an updated version of 
our CoC:

disclosed
   - Approach generated material with caution as it may "hallucinate" or contain wrong 
information
   - Maintain traceability of LLM use by referencing original human-made text and storing chat 
logs in the Git repo.

>>> Can you give a different suggestion on how to prevent conflicts?
1. Regular team building activities: Organize periodic team-building events or exercises that 
encourage trust, communication, and collaboration among team members. This can help establish a 
stronger bond between teammates, making it easier for them to resolve conflicts when they arise.
  2. Conflict resolution training: Provide team members with conflict resolution skills 
training, such as effective listening, assertive communication, and negotiation techniques. 
Having these tools at their disposal will help them navigate disagreements more effectively and 
reach a mutually acceptable solution.
  3. Establish clear roles and responsibilities: Clearly define each team member's role and 
responsibilities within the project, as well as any decision-making processes or protocols that 
need to be followed. This can help minimize confusion and prevent conflicts from arising due to 
unclear expectations or overlapping responsibilities.
  4. Implement a conflict resolution process: Create a documented process for resolving 
conflicts that includes steps such as identifying the issue, discussing it openly and honestly, 
seeking common ground, and finding a mutually agreeable solution. This can provide a structure 
for addressing disagreements when they occur and ensure that they are resolved in a fair and 
timely manner.
  5. Encourage constructive feedback: Foster an environment where team members feel comfortable 
giving and receiving feedback, both positive and negative. This can help identify potential 
conflicts early on and enable team members to address them proactively before they escalate.

By incorporating these suggestions into our CoC, we can create a more conducive environment for 
resolving conflicts effectively and maintaining a productive working relationship within the 
group.
